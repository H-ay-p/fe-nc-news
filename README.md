Developed using node.js v22.9.0.

This is the front end for the NC News project (backend at https://nc-news-3wsj.onrender.com/api/
) where users can read articles, comment on articles, like/dislike articles and delete their own comments. Articles can be sorted and filtered by various parameters such as date, topic, likes and comments.

After cloning the repository, make sure the back end is up and running, and run "npm run dev". This will give you a link to click to view the project in the browser.
